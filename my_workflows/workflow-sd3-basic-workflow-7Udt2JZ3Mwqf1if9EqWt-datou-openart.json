The portrait focuses closely on the dog's expressive face against a soft, natural background.\nThe golden retriever's warm, rich coat is resplendent, with hues ranging from light golden cream to deep reddish gold, shimmering in the gentle light. Each hair is rendered in stunning detail, from the short, dense undercoat to the longer, wavy outer coat, showcasing the breed's iconic feathering on the neck, chest, back of the legs, and tail.\nThe dog's kind, intelligent eyes are the focal point, a deep soulful brown that emanates warmth, understanding, and an almost human-like emotional depth. The eyes are gently rounded, with a soft, empathetic gaze that invites connection and trust. The black rims around the eyes provide a striking contrast, further emphasizing their expressiveness."],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":71,"type":"CLIPTextEncode","pos":[1550,760],"size":{"0":380.4615783691406,"1":102.07693481445312},"flags":{},"order":5,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"clip","type":"CLIP","link":606}],"outputs":[{"name":"CONDITIONING","type":"CONDITIONING","links":[610],"shape":3,"slot_index":0}],"title":"CLIP Text Encode (Negative Prompt)","properties":{"Node name for S&R":"CLIPTextEncode"},"widgets_values":["bad quality, poor quality, doll, disfigured, jpg, toy, bad anatomy, missing limbs, missing fingers, 3d, cgi"],"color":"#322","bgcolor":"#533"},{"id":274,"type":"SDXLAspectRatioSelector","pos":[1550,920],"size":{"0":380,"1":100},"flags":{},"order":0,"mode":0,"outputs":[{"name":"ratio","type":"STRING","links":null,"shape":3},{"name":"width","type":"INT","links":[601],"shape":3,"slot_index":1},{"name":"height","type":"INT","links":[602],"shape":3,"slot_index":2}],"properties":{"Node name for S&R":"SDXLAspectRatioSelector"},"widgets_values":["1:1"]},{"id":135,"type":"EmptySD3LatentImage","pos":[1300,1230],"size":{"0":210,"1":80},"flags":{},"order":4,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"width","type":"INT","link":601,"widget":{"name":"width"}},{"name":"height","type":"INT","link":602,"widget":{"name":"height"}}],"outputs":[{"name":"LATENT","type":"LATENT","links":[593],"shape":3,"slot_index":0}],"properties":{"Node name for S&R":"EmptySD3LatentImage"},"widgets_values":[1024,1024,1]},{"id":273,"type":"SaveImage","pos":[2000,600],"size":{"0":580,"1":630},"flags":{},"order":9,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"images","type":"IMAGE","link":600}],"title":"@Datou","properties":{"Node name for S&R":"SaveImage"},"widgets_values":["sd3/comfy_"]},{"id":266,"type":"Note","pos":[1550,1060],"size":{"0":380,"1":60},"flags":{},"order":1,"mode":0,"properties":{"text":""},"widgets_values":["Resolution should be around 1 megapixel and width/height must be multiple of 64"],"color":"#432","bgcolor":"#653"},{"id":231,"type":"VAEDecode","pos":[2000,1280],"size":{"0":210,"1":46},"flags":{},"order":8,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"samples","type":"LATENT","link":596},{"name":"vae","type":"VAE","link":557}],"outputs":[{"name":"IMAGE","type":"IMAGE","links":[600],"shape":3,"slot_index":0}],"properties":{"Node name for S&R":"VAEDecode"}},{"id":271,"type":"KSampler","pos":[1550,1170],"size":{"0":380,"1":470},"flags":{},"order":7,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"model","type":"MODEL","link":611},{"name":"positive","type":"CONDITIONING","link":595},{"name":"negative","type":"CONDITIONING","link":610},{"name":"latent_image","type":"LATENT","link":593}],"outputs":[{"name":"LATENT","type":"LATENT","links":[596],"shape":3,"slot_index":0}],"properties":{"Node name for S&R":"KSampler"},"widgets_values":[71844603528225,"randomize",28,4.1,"dpmpp_2m","sgm_uniform",1]},{"id":277,"type":"Note","pos":[890,930],"size":{"0":360,"1":370},"flags":{},"order":2,"mode":0,"properties":{"text":""},"widgets_values":["checkpoints:\nhttps://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium/tree/main\n(ComfyUI\\models\\checkpoints\\sd3)\n\nsd3_medium.safetensors includes the MMDiT and VAE weights but does not include any text encoders.üëé\n\nsd3_medium_incl_clips.safetensors includes all necessary weights except for the T5XXL text encoder.
