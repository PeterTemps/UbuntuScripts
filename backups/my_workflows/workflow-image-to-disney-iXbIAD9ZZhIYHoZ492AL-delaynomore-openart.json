However, I can assume they are both male since they are described as wearing sports attire. So, I'll list them as:\n\n- 2 men\n\nStep 2: Use a short phrase to describe all the characters in the prompt.\nSince there is no specific information about their personalities or characteristics, I'll use a general phrase that describes them:\n\n- 2 male athletes\n\nStep 3: Identify the main subjects in the prompt. In this case, it's clear that the two men are the focus of the image.\n\nStep 4: Combine the contents of the previous two steps, separated by commas.\nHere's the combined result:\n\n- 2 male athletes from stadium scene\n\nStep 5: Refine the prompt as a whole.\nBased on the description, I'll create a refined prompt that incorporates the details and style specified in the prompt (Disney style):\n\n【1 boy and 1 boy, two soccer players from Disney, standing together on a sunny outdoor stadium, smiling, looking at the camera, medals around their necks, shiny gold and blue colors, dynamic pose, energetic atmosphere, lively crowd in the background, perfect composition, illustration】\n\nNote that I've used \"boy\" instead of \"man\" since it's more fitting for the Disney style. Also, I've emphasized the dynamic pose and energetic atmosphere to match the description.\n\nStep 6: Enclose the result within 【】\nThe final refined prompt is:\n\n【1 boy and 1 boy, two soccer players from Disney, standing together on a sunny outdoor stadium, smiling, looking at the camera, medals around their necks, shiny gold and blue colors, dynamic pose, energetic atmosphere, lively crowd in the background, perfect composition, illustration】"]},{"id":151,"type":"CR Text","pos":[1120,-1310],"size":{"0":490,"1":830},"flags":{},"order":0,"mode":0,"outputs":[{"name":"text","type":"*","links":[266],"shape":3,"slot_index":0},{"name":"show_help","type":"STRING","links":null,"shape":3}],"properties":{"Node name for S&R":"CR Text"},"widgets_values":["\nYou are a prompt engineer proficient in SDXL painting, especially skilled in refining prompts.
